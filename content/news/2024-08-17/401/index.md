On August 17 Organic Maps was removed from the Google Play Store without any warnings or additional details due to "not meeting the requirements for the Family Program". Compared to Google Maps and other maps apps rated for 3+ age, there are no ads or in-app purchases in Organic Maps, and no user information is collected. We have asked for an appeal. 

As a temporary workaround for the Google Play issue, you can install the new upcoming Google Play update from [this link][https://cdn.organicmaps.app/apk/OrganicMaps-24081605-GooglePlay.apk].
